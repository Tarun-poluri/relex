UI Elements & Modals

4.1. Consistent Modals/Dialogs for User Confirmation
AlertDialogs or Dialogs: Use from @/components/ui for confirmation or data entry.

State Control: Use useState to control the open/closed state.

Clear Communication: AlertDialogTitle and AlertDialogDescription must clearly state the action and its implications.

Confirmation Actions: AlertDialogAction for data modification, AlertDialogCancel to close.

4.1.2 Action-Oriented UI Elements
Clear Labels: Buttons and menu items should have descriptive labels (e.g., "Create User", "Edit User").

Icons: Use relevant lucide-react icons (e.g., Plus, Edit, Trash2, UserX, UserCheck).

Dropdown Menus: Use DropdownMenu for multiple actions on a single item.

Conditional Rendering: Display actions conditionally based on data state (e.g., "Deactivate" for active users, "Activate" for inactive users).
