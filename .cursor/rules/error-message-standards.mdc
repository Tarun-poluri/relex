Form Validation Error Message Standards
Principles
Clarity: Error messages should clearly state what is wrong

Actionable: Messages should indicate how to fix the problem

Consistent: Similar errors should have similar messages

Concise: Messages should be brief but informative

Friendly: Messages should avoid accusatory or technical language

Standard Error Message Formats
Required Field Errors
"[Field name] is required"

Examples:

"First name is required"

"Email is required"

"Date of birth is required"

Length Restriction Errors
"[Field name] must be at least [n] characters"
"[Field name] must be at most [n] characters"
"[Field name] must be exactly [n] characters"

Examples:

"Password must be at least 8 characters"

"Username must be at most 20 characters"

"Verification code must be exactly 6 characters"

Format Restriction Errors

"[Field name] must contain [requirement]"
"[Field name] must be in [format] format"

Examples:

"Email is invalid"

"Password must contain at least one number"

"Date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format"

Match Errors
"[Field names] do not match"

Examples:

"Passwords do not match"

"Email addresses do not match"

Boolean Field Errors
"You must [action]"

Examples:

"You must agree to the terms and conditions"

"You must confirm your age"

Complex Validation Errors
For fields with multiple potential validation failures:

Check for empty first

Check for length restrictions

Check for format/pattern restrictions

Check for cross-field validations
