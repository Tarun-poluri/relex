# Form Validation Error Message Standards

## Principles

1. **Clarity**: Error messages should clearly state what is wrong
2. **Actionable**: Messages should indicate how to fix the problem
3. **Consistent**: Similar errors should have similar messages
4. **Concise**: Messages should be brief but informative
5. **Friendly**: Messages should avoid accusatory or technical language

## Standard Error Message Formats

### Required Field Errors

```
"[Field name] is required"
```

Examples:
- "First name is required"
- "Email is required"
- "Date of birth is required"

### Length Restriction Errors

```
"[Field name] must be at least [n] characters"
"[Field name] must be at most [n] characters"
"[Field name] must be exactly [n] characters"
```

Examples:
- "Password must be at least 8 characters"
- "Username must be at most 20 characters"
- "Verification code must be exactly 6 characters"

### Format Restriction Errors

```
"[Field name] is invalid"
"[Field name] must contain [requirement]"
"[Field name] must be in [format] format"
```

Examples:
- "Email is invalid"
- "Password must contain at least one number"
- "Date must be in DD/MM/YYYY format"

### Match Errors

```
"[Field names] do not match"
```

Examples:
- "Passwords do not match"
- "Email addresses do not match"

### Boolean Field Errors

```
"You must [action]"
```

Examples:
- "You must agree to the terms and conditions"
- "You must confirm your age"

### Complex Validation Errors

For fields with multiple potential validation failures:

1. Check for empty first
2. Check for length restrictions
3. Check for format/pattern restrictions
4. Check for cross-field validations

## Error Message Style Guide

1. Start with capital letter
2. End without punctuation
3. Use present tense
4. Be direct and specific
5. Avoid technical jargon
6. Use consistent terminology for the same field across the application
